# SnesJs
A SNES emulator, in javascript

My attempt at making a SNES emulator in Javascript. Currently working on the CPU emulation.

This will probably never end up being an accurate emulator, but I hope to have some game running at least. There is also a pretty big chance that it won't be able to run at full speed.

## Resources

Resources that I used for implementing this:

- The WDC datasheet for the W65C816S cpu.
- The [65C816 opcodes tutorial](http://6502.org/tutorials/65c816opcodes.html) from 6502.org.
